# Data_Munging_Using_The_Command_Line
In this project, we worked with datasets on U.S. housing affordability from the [U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html) to do data munging using the command line to make them easier to work with. However, datasets are available to download below:
